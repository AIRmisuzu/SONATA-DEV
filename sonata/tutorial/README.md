## Sonata Assignment

### Background
We provide a brief background to Sonata. We describe its architecture
and how Sonata makes it easier for the network operators to express range 
of telemetry queries and uses programmable data-plane and streaming targets 
to scale their execution.

### Part-1: Compiling Dataflow Queries for PISA Targets
In this part, we will understand how one can execute simple dataflow
queries in the data plane itself. 

### Part-2: Expressing Dataflow Queries for Telemetry Applications
In this part, we will understand how one can use Sonata to express
dataflow queries to express range of telemetry applications.
