## Sonata Tutorial

### Background
[Here](https://github.com/Sonata-Princeton/SONATA-DEV/blob/tutorial/sonata/tutorial/introduction.md), 
we will first provide an overview of Sonata describing its architecture and how simplifies it 
expressing a range of telemetry queries for the network operators. We will also describe how 
Sonata uses programmable data-plane and streaming targets to scale query execution. 

### Installation
Follow the instructions 
[here](https://github.com/Sonata-Princeton/SONATA-DEV/blob/tutorial/installation.md) 
to get started.


### Part-1: Compiling Dataflow Queries for PISA Targets
In this [part](https://github.com/Sonata-Princeton/SONATA-DEV/tree/tutorial/sonata/tutorial/Part-1), 
we will learn how to execute simple dataflow queries with PISA targets using P4.

### Part-2: Expressing Queries for Telemetry Applications
In this [part](https://github.com/Sonata-Princeton/SONATA-DEV/tree/tutorial/sonata/tutorial/Part-2), 
we will learn how to use Sonata's query interface to express queries for a range of telemetry 
applications.
