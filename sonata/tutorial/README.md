## Sonata Assignment
I’ll first provide an overview of  Sonata where I’ll talk about its architecture 
and how it simplifies expressing a range of telemetry queries for the network 
operators. I’ll also talk about how Sonata uses programmable data-plane and 
streaming targets to scale query execution. 

### Background
We will first provide an overview of Sonata where we will describe its
architecture and how simplifies it expressing a range of telemetry queries 
for the network operators. We will also describe how Sonata uses programmable 
data-plane and streaming targets to scale query execution. 

### Part-1: Compiling Dataflow Queries for PISA Targets
In this part, we will learn how to execute simple dataflow queries with PISA targets
using P4.

### Part-2: Expressing Dataflow Queries for Telemetry Applications
In this part, we will learn how to use Sonata's query interface to express
a range of telemetry applications.
