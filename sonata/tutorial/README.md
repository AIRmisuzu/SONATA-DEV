## Sonata Assignment

### Background
We will first provide an overview of Sonata where we will describe its
architecture and how simplifies it expressing a range of telemetry queries 
for the network operators. We will also describe how Sonata uses programmable 
data-plane and streaming targets to scale query execution. 

### Installation
Follow the instructions 
[here](https://github.com/Sonata-Princeton/SONATA-DEV/blob/tutorial/installation.md) 
to get started.


### Part-1: Compiling Dataflow Queries for PISA Targets
In this part, we will learn how to execute simple dataflow queries with PISA targets
using P4.

### Part-2: Expressing Dataflow Queries for Telemetry Applications
In this part, we will learn how to use Sonata's query interface to express
a range of telemetry applications.
